# Movies Database App


## Introduction

This repository created the first time for my own benefit of practicing back-end technology using Python and PostgreSQL. I am new to programming and came from a non-IT background. And this repository originally created from one of my MOOC's course, where the teacher guided me to make and illustrating the flow using practical approach. I might keep update/modify it as I learn new things that could integrate with this app while broaden my knowledge in back-end technologies over time. 


## What is this app for

This app generally is a private project for practising some sort of back-end programming about connecting an app to the database, using Python and PostgreSQL.
I think this is not meant to deploy or use for a public purposes, because everything written here using an illustration, designed merely for practice.


## How to Support

If you have an idea that somehow worth to add on my little practice-project, you could directly involve and I will very grateful for your kindness to share your knowledge to me.

I also wanna say **Thank you** to @jslvtr for the course, and to all of you who give me an input.
